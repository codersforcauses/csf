# Email

MailHog is being used to test the sending of emails. It is an email-testing tool with a fake SMTP server underneath. To view the emails which have been sent, open `http://localhost:8025/` in your browser, which will open the MailHog user interface.

If you haven't got it installed already, Mailhog should automatically install when you run `docker compose up`.
